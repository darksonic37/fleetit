# Vision and Scope

Rent bicycles are becoming increasingly popular around the world. People rent these bicycles to go and explore many places in a city.

**But there is a problem.**

This rent bicycles are not monitored at all. A user might damage them without taking responsability for it, or even steal them. 

The idea was first to create only a platform to monitor the rented BUGAs. However, nowadays rented bicycles are becoming more and more popular. 
So, we decided to expand the "universe" of our platform and allow it to be used by multiple rental shops, making it possible for many stores to monitor their bikes.

With a sensor attached to each bicycle and sending information which is displayed in a web API, it is possible for workers of the rental stores to know about the location and speed of the bicycle, heart rate of the user, battery level of the sensors and some other relevant warnings.
