#### What is the purpose of this project? 

Bicycle rental systems are becoming more and more popular, with an increasing number of people opting to cycle to work, electing it as a means to tour the city, and choosing it as an overall, environment friendly, way to get around, within the city. This has resulted in a fleet of bicycles invading urban areas.

Unfortunately, these bicycles are often prone to being abused and stolen, as such, Fleet was created in an attempt to mitigate these situations, while bringing much more to the table.

A set of sensors are assembled into a nifty little kit, which is attached to the bicycles. Then, our service is able to track the bicycle, gather information about the current environment, and combine these with biometric information from sensors the user may wear.
