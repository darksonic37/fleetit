 John is a worker at a bike rental shop.

<br>

John works at a bike rental shop. The bicycles he rents are not monitored and, because of that, they are prone to being stolen or damaged, without the client taking responsibility for it. 

<br>

**Scenario 1: Real time values collected**

John wants to know where a rented bicycle is located in that particular moment. He needs a map that shows him those locations live. This map also allows John to click each of the bicycle pinpoint representations and get more real time detailed information about it and it's environment.

**Scenario 2: Persistence of values**

John wants to check the values captured in one of the bicycles during the last few days, perhaps to evaluate the behaviour of a user in a recent deal. In the page dedicated to a particular bicycle it is possible to obtain processed details about some of the latest values, average of the last 30 days being the default. This is taking advantage of the broker's inherent persistence. 

John also wants to analyse the values for each bicycle in more detail throughout a certain period of time in the past, or simply a longer period of time. All the values received about each bicycle are stored in persistence along with a timestamp, allowing for consultation and review. Information from multiple bicycles may be compiled and correlated by John, and perhaps used to study different routes through the city. This could prove useful for tourism or overall efficiency in travelling. Another example would be making use of heart rate records in order to study the health of the areaâ€™s population, boost the creation of other technologies (like fitness programs), or just overall understanding of the cycling activity in terms of cardio.

**Scenario 3: Alerts**

John wants to be alerted when certain conditions are met. For instance, he wants to receive an alert when the heart rate value of a cyclist is seemingly abnormal, in which case John will possibly call for help. Another example would be if the bicycle is surpassing a certain speed limit, this way John might consider a hypothetical theft of the bicycle. FInally, receiving an alert when the sensor attached to the bicycle is running low on battery, this way John will remember to recharge it before another client rents it.
